### Graph Algorithms and Data Structures
- BFS – Queue, Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix (for dense graphs)
- DFS – Stack, Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix (for dense graphs)
- Dijkstra – Priority Queue (Heap), Adjacency List, CSR (for large sparse graphs), Adjacency Matrix (optional)
- Prim – Priority Queue (Heap), Adjacency List, CSR, Adjacency Matrix
- Kruskal – Disjoint Set (Union-Find), Edge List, CSR (if working with large sparse graphs)
- Topological Sort – Stack, Adjacency List
- Ford-Fulkerson – Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix (alternative), CSR (for performance)
